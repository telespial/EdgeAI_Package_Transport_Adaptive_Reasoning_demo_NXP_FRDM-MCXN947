# EdgeAI Package Transport Anomaly Demo (FRDM-MCXN947)

Standalone embedded intelligence firmware for **FRDM-MCXN947 + LCD-PAR-S035** that layers adaptive anomaly monitoring on top of standard host firmware logic.

This project is designed as a practical "AI watchover" system:
- host firmware keeps deterministic control behavior,
- the intelligence layer scores risk, detects drift/anomaly, and emits explainable reason codes,
- logs and flash recording preserve timestamped evidence for replay and tuning.

## What This Device Does

### Intelligence Layer (AI-Assisted)
- Adaptive anomaly scoring from multi-sensor channels.
- Deterministic warning/fault transitions with explicit reason codes.
- Predictive warning signals (inversion, tilt, temp approach, erratic motion).
- On-device train/record/play/live workflow (no mandatory CSV round-trip).
- Severity-priority alert policy with visibility hold:
  - higher severity always overrides lower severity,
  - warning hold: 5s minimum,
  - fault hold: 8s minimum.

### Host Firmware Layer (Deterministic)
- Sensor bus handling and decode.
- UI rendering, controls, and operator interactions.
- External flash recording/replay with timeline controls.
- Persistent settings on reboot (mode, AI on/off, limits, log rate).

## Architecture Summary

The firmware intentionally separates responsibilities:
1. Sensor and protocol complexity stays in host firmware.
2. The intelligence layer consumes normalized decoded channels.
3. Output is an explainable decision layer (`status + reason + score`) that complements host algorithms.

This keeps integration portable and makes behavior auditable.

## EIL Profile Workflow (VS Extension -> Firmware)

1. Build profile in the EIL extension (`model.config.json`).
2. Export profile package.
3. Import profile into firmware:

```bash
python3 tools/import_eil_profile.py \
  --model /path/to/model.config.json \
  --out src/eil_profile_generated.h
```

4. Build and flash firmware.

Current integration uses:
- profile alert thresholds -> firmware warning/fault boundaries,
- profile input weights -> weighted anomaly score computation.

## Build And Flash

```bash
./tools/bootstrap_ubuntu_user.sh
./tools/setup_mcuxsdk_ws.sh
BUILD_DIR=mcuxsdk_ws/build_adaptive_reasoning ./tools/build_frdmmcxn947.sh debug
BUILD_DIR=mcuxsdk_ws/build_adaptive_reasoning ./tools/flash_frdmmcxn947.sh
```

## Operator Controls

- `MODE`: `ADAPT` / `TRAINED`
- `RUN`: `TRAIN` / `LIVE`
- Timeline: `PLAY` + `RECORD/STOP`
- Limits: `G WARN`, `G FAIL`, `TEMP LOW`, `TEMP HIGH`, `GYRO LIMIT`
- Logging: `LOG HZ` = 1/5/10/20/30/40/50 Hz
- Maintenance: `CLEAR FLASH` (confirm popup)

## Data Recording And Evidence

Each flash row stores:
- timestamp (`ts_ds`),
- accel/gyro/mag/temp/baro channels,
- anomaly score,
- alert status,
- alert reason code.

This supports replay and post-event analysis with explicit cause visibility.
